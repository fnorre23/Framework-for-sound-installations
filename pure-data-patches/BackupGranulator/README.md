# ys.granular
 a pretty standard granular audio exploration system, made in Pure Data (Pd) 'vanilla'. an improvement on the various other granular things i've made...this is the last one now! i promise! 

the main patch is found in _main.pd

there's a help file in there too. you can have multiple instances of the granular part running at once.

Here's a video that explains the patch in some detail: https://youtu.be/gRKfyIT_yF0
